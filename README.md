# D√ªgev Wiki Frontend ‚Ñ¢ üìñ

## What is D√ªgev üó∫Ô∏è

D√ªgev or also written as Duegev is a role-playing game that was realized by **Shambr** in the early 2000s. You can control your own countries, and history. The game is very popular in our friend group, and we used to (and still do) document everything on paper. But this project brings all of our collective knowledge online, in a **searchable**, **single source** of thruth form.

To access this project, you have to have to have to have access to our own VPN Server and credentials to our intranet. When your VPN is active, and the authentication is successful, you can browse our intranet in your browser, and you can find **Duegev Wiki Frontend‚Ñ¢** and **Duegev Wiki Backend‚Ñ¢** both written and maintained by [FrancisStudios](https://github.com/francisstudios) as **Dynar Software Technologies Inc.** in-game corporation.

## D√ªgev Wiki Frontend üåê

This project allows users to access and interact with the Duegev Wiki Database via a nice, modern, material design web application. 

This is the third major version of the Duegev Wiki project
1) PHP WP Duegev Wiki that was hosted online
2) Angular SPA Duegev Wiki, that was built but never really took off.
3) React SPA Duegev Wiki Frontend - current application hosted on our intranet

## D√ªgev Wiki Backend üîå

You can also access the [Duegev Wiki Backend](https://github.com/FrancisStudios/duegev-backend) on our intranet server, so you can interface with the Duegev Database programmatically. You will find the documentation under the repository's README.md
